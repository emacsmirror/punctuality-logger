Currently, **punctuality-logger** supports three interactive functions.

* **punctuality-logger-new-log** asks you if you were late today and, if so, how many minutes you were late. It then creates a new log entry with your input.

* **punctuality-logger-late-days** lists in a new buffer the days you were late.

* **punctuality-logger-all-days** lists in a new buffer all the days in the log.

These functions are also available from the top-menu *Tools->Punctuality Logger*.
